# Bagek's Equiney Addon

Bagek's Equiney Addon is an addon that is created in addition to popular Equestrian mod SWEM. This addon brings a new variety of tack from new colours, disciplines, and more! This addon also brings more of the feeding/drinking blocks in the Bagek colours.

This addon does not replace any of the current SWEM tack/blocks nor any other SWEM addon items. It instead adds new tack sets for your pony.

**Join Bagek's official discord for future updates and more! :**

## About The Mod

Bagek's Equiney Addon is an equestrian based addon for SWEM, this mod brings both new tack colours, sets, textures, as well as includes 28 new colours of the original SWEM feeders, barrels, bins, tackboxes and slow feeders.

All tack and blocks will be created using the custom workbench created within the mod. The workbench works similar to the stonecutter by adding the colour dye then selecting the tack or block you'd like. JEI is also still supported by this addon.

Besides the new tack and blocks the Equiney addon will have side mods/packs like;

**♞** Bagek's Decoration Mod  
**♞** Bagek's Coat Add-On  
**♞** Bagek's Community Packs

*   Bagek's Decoration mod will be available for 1.18.2 & 1.20.1
*   Bagek's Equiney Addon will be available for 1.20.1, 1.21 (when SWEM releases), 1.18.2 & 1.16.5
